# Projects
Welcome to my 1st-year Engineering Python projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of simple yet impactful Python projects that I developed during my first year. The projects encompass various aspects of programming, ranging from utility programs like a Calculator and Password Generator to entertaining games like Stone-Paper-Scissors. Each project is enclosed within its dedicated folder, containing detailed README files with descriptions and usage instructions. These projects are perfect for beginners looking to learn Python fundamentals and explore basic programming concepts. Feel free to explore the code, use it as a reference for your own projects, or even contribute to enhance them further. I hope these projects serve as a valuable resource and inspire you to embark on your Python coding journey!
